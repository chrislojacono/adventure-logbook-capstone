# The Adventure Logbook
This is my capstone project for my front-end development semester at The Nashville Software School. It will be a site to find and keep track of rock climbs a user would like to do in the future and a log of the ones completed in the past. The user will be able to save the climbs individually or tie them to a trip they plan on going on in the future
